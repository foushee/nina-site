  When I was writing a research grant proposal, Nina helped me refine my writing with care and clarity. She was able to help me view the piece as a whole, she quickly understood the needs and objectives the proposal needed to meet to be successful, and with her guidance the work went from being a document that answered the necessary questions to a persuasive explanation of the value of the research to be done. Plus, she’s a joy to be around. Editing my own writing has never been so fun.
